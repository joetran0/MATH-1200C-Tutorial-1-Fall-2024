        <h1>SC/MATH 1200 3.00 C Tutorial 1 Problems, Conjectures, and Proofs</h1>
        <h2><i>Welcome to MATH 1200 Tutorial!</i></h2>

        <p>This page is meant for the students in my tutorial section for MATH 1200 during the Fall 2024 semester. I will post my materials here and will also provide a summary of what was covered in each tutorial.</p>

        <p>I am okay with you addressing me by my first name, Joe.</p>

        <p>On the side, I am also the President of Club Infinity this year, and I will also be happy to have a chat about some of my past experiences here at York University, so you can get the general idea of what York is like.</p>

        <h3>Tutorial Notes and Brief Summaries</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="MATH 1200C Tutorial 1 Fall 2024.pdf">Week 1</a> (Sept. 5, 2024): We introduced LaTeX and got you all started on how to use it. This will be needed as for your first, and other assignments in MATH 1200, assignments are to be done in LaTeX. I have included the slides and documentation from the LaTeX document from today. I have also attached an additional resource that may be useful.</li>

            <li><a href="MATH 1200C Tutorial 2 Fall 2024.pdf">Week 2</a> (Sept. 12, 2024): We had a look at some discussion prompts related to mathematical logic and conditional statements, where I also got you to participate and discuss in small groups about the prompt. We also went over some of the concepts that you have talked about during the lecture, including mathematical statements, logical equivalences, and truth tables.</li>
            <li><a href="MATH 1200C Tutorial 3 Fall 2024.pdf">Week 3</a> (Sept. 19, 2024): This is one of the tutorial sessions where we learn how to write proofs in mathematics. We looked at how to find counterexamples, write proofs using definitions, and looked at some examples.</li>
            <li><a href="MATH 1200C Tutorial 4 Fall 2024.pdf">Week 4</a> (Sept. 26, 2024): We went more into depth on using definitions to write proofs, as well as formulating a proof directly. We also had a look at examples on how to prove statements via contradiction. We also went through an example of proof by contradiction for extra time, and as promised, I've attached a reference material as well as additional problems for you to try and do. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</li>

            <li><a href="MATH 1200C Tutorial 5 Fall 2024.pdf">Week 5</a> (Oct. 4, 2024): Today, we touched on topics including Proof by Cases and Proof by Contraposition. We also had a look at some examples that involved cases where we can simply consider the phrase “without loss of generality”. We also had a look at some examples trying to get used to write proofs in any different method. Next week, we will start having a look at Mathematical Induction. Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</li>

            <li><a href="MATH 1200C Tutorial 6 Fall 2024.pdf">Week 6</a> (Oct. 11, 2024): Today, we covered topics related to mathematical induction. We touched on some of the important steps that we would need to consider when proving statements using mathematical induction. Mathematical induction is very useful for proving mathematical formulas and proving statements that involve induction.</li>
